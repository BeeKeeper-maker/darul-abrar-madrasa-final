## Steps to Complete:
- [x] Complete the incomplete SVG path and navigation link for "Children's Results"
- [x] Add the missing navigation links for guardian role (likely "Children's Fees")
- [x] Close all the conditional @if statements with proper @endif tags
- [x] Close the main @auth directive with @endauth
- [x] Test the fix by checking if the website loads without syntax errors

## Progress:

- ✅ Added "Children's Fees" navigation link for guardian role
